#
# commands and queries are handled differently
#
# commands modify state, so they're automatically directed to the leader to go through a consensus round
#
# queries read state, their handling depends on the level of consistency desired:
#   - linearizable queries are always directed to the leader
#     - if leader leases are enabled (you're using an accurate time source), the leader's machine can immediately process the request
#     - otherwise, we need to wait for a round of consenus to occur to confirm that the leader is still the leader
#       - when a client makes a query, the machine process simply buffers it
#       - when the next consensus round achieves consensus, the consensus process informs the machine process of the (possibly bumped) commit index
#       - the machine process flushes the buffer and processes all waiting queries
#
#  - eventually consistent queries are immediately processed by the receiving node (random node or one provided by the user)
#    - if the user consistently uses the same node, monotonic read consistency is supported
#    - otherwise, if the user leaves it up to craft to pick a random node, there are no consistency guarantees, state can be arbitrarily stale, and even violate causality
