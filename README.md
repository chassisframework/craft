# Craft

todo:
- multi-raft
- cluster splitting
- smart appendentries intervals for commands (immediate, interval-based batching...)
- broadcast replication lag to clients, to allow them to target non-linearizable reads to specific followers
- be consistent with "members" vs "nodes" nomenclature
- adaptive heartbeat intervals based on statistical analysis of full mesh ping times (send icmp via raw sockets)
- 4.2.1 server catch up "rounds" hueristic

done:
- snapshot deletion when no longer needed
- leader leases for linearizable reads
- nemesis development
- linearizability checker + visualizer
- Logger visualizer
- 3.10 leadership transfer extension
- PreVote
- CheckQuorum
- rocksdb backend

- snapshots
  when commit index bumps, consensus sends a message to machine to bump index and optionally snapshot
  if snapshotting, machine snapshots and sends message to consensus with snapshot index and path on disk
  consensus writes snapshot metadata to persistence
  break out to own SnapshotsManager process?
  sendfile support
  
- log truncation
  runs periodically
  asks persistence for all snapshots, finds the most recent non-busy (not sending to follower) one, and truncates log to that point

  for consideration: if a follower is slow in catching up, and the log is snapshotted/truncated on the leader, how should the follower respond?
    nuke the follower's current state and start over fresh?

- querying (eventual, linearizable)
  - linearizable reads without log entry
